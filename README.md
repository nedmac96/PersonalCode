Code written by Camden Chappelle

A sampling of several projects I have created from the age of 8. Intended for code and idea exploration and desperately in need of comments and cleaning up as my programming skills progressed over the years.

If you are reviewing this codebase and would like me to explain or provide more coherent code for review, please let me know and I'd be happy to oblige the request.
